## Assignment: Course Project 2
## Question:
## Of the four types of sources indicated by the type (point, nonpoint, 
## onroad, nonroad) variable, which of these four sources have seen decreases in emissions 
## from 1999-2008 for Baltimore City? Which have seen increases in emissions from 1999-2008? 
## Use the ggplot2 plotting system to make a plot answer this question.

# Read in emissions dataset
emissions.df <- readRDS('summarySCC_PM25.rds')
scc.df <- readRDS('Source_Classification_Code.rds')

# Get the emissions in Baltimore City
baltimore.emissions.df = emissions.df[emissions.df$fips == '24510', ]

# Get the total emissions in Baltimore, grouped by type and year
baltimore.emission.totals.df <- aggregate(Emissions ~ type + year, baltimore.emissions.df, FUN = sum)

# Create Plot
png(filename='plot3.png', width=1200, height=640, units='px')
options(scipen=10)

plot3 <- qplot(year, Emissions, data=baltimore.emission.totals.df, facets = . ~ type) +  
  geom_line() +
  xlab("Year") +
  ylab('PM2.5 Emissions (tons)') +
  ggtitle('Total PM2.5 Emissions in Baltimore City')

print(plot3)
